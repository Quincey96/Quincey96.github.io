                                    I am immensely proud of every single Amanzimtoti High learner.
                                    Thank you very much for the way in which you have accepted the
                                    reality of 2020.
                                    It was not always easy, but you did it – and the result is that you
 Miss R. Delport  Mrs M. Wagner  Miss M. Wilson  have evolved stronger and far greater at the end of it all.                                                               Mrs L. Lemmer                         Mr H. Kapp


                                    This year will form part of History–and you will be a major part of it.
                                    The hardships that you faced this year certainly contributed so
                                    much to who you are today.
      Attitude is everything in life.  Your attitude determines your altitude.  I fully believe that the
      attitude that you approached your challenges with this year, is what has made all the diﬀerence.
      You are a dedicated group of learners, displaying tenacity and courage.
      I know you will be able to approach your future head on and achieve huge successes.

      Remember to never stop moving forward.  On this path of life, many of us will stumble along
 Mrs S. Naidoo  Mrs M. Haggie  Mr K. Buck   the way.  Get up, dust yourself oﬀ and continue, no matter how dark it may seem at the time.    Mrs C. Verrall                 Mr N. Khuzwayo                      Mrs D. Lindeque
      There is always a light ahead.  Just dig deep into your inner strength and let your own light
      shine even brighter.
      The greatest thing that you can do for yourself is to use every opportunity.
      Continue to be the hero that you are destined to be.
      Always strive to be the better version of yourself.
      Bruce Lee said:  ”Pain is a privilege.  Use it to become stronger, bolder and better.”
      Always remember the words of Jeremiah 29:11:  “For I know the plans I have for you, declares
      the Lord, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future”.
      With my best wishes,

                                    ways. During the past ﬁve years, we have got to know most of you
                                    quite well. We met your parents, guardians, other family members.
                                    We learned many family stories, some personality traits, your

                                    that all of you felt in your time here, that Amanzimtoti High School
                                    was not only a place where you were taught subject knowledge, but

 2020 has most certainly been a year that has brought about huge
 challenges.  However, 2020 has also provided great opportunities.
 I am immensely proud of every single Amanzimtoti High learner.
 Thank you very much for the way in which you have accepted the
 reality of 2020.
 It was not always easy, but you did it – and the result is that you
 have evolved stronger and far greater at the end of it all.

 This year will form part of History–and you will be a major part of it.
 The hardships that you faced this year certainly contributed so
     much to who you are today.
 Attitude is everything in life.  Your attitude determines your altitude.  I fully believe that the
 attitude that you approached your challenges with this year, is what has made all the diﬀerence.
 You are a dedicated group of learners, displaying tenacity and courage.
 I know you will be able to approach your future head on and achieve huge successes.

 Remember to never stop moving forward.  On this path of life, many of us will stumble along
  the way.  Get up, dust yourself oﬀ and continue, no matter how dark it may seem at the time.
 There is always a light ahead.  Just dig deep into your inner strength and let your own light
 shine even brighter.
 The greatest thing that you can do for yourself is to use every opportunity.
 Continue to be the hero that you are destined to be.
 Always strive to be the better version of yourself.
 Bruce Lee said:  ”Pain is a privilege.  Use it to become stronger, bolder and better.”
 Always remember the words of Jeremiah 29:11:  “For I know the plans I have for you, declares
 the Lord, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future”.
 With my best wishes,
 Deputy Principal  Mr Kapp
 Deputy Principal
 Mrs Lemmer


 Saying goodbye to our Matrics is always a bittersweet moment.
 On the one hand, we are happy that you have achieved your goal
 and can move on to better things, on the other, it is sad to part
 ways. During the past ﬁve years, we have got to know most of you
 quite well. We met your parents, guardians, other family members.
 We learned many family stories, some personality traits, your
 strengths and your weaknesses. For ﬁve years, we tried, to the best
 of our ability, to give you the most suitable tools for your future.
 We may have made mistakes along the way, but what I can
 promise you is that we had your best interests at heart. I hope
 that all of you felt in your time here, that Amanzimtoti High School
 was not only a place where you were taught subject knowledge, but
 also a place where you learned values and a place where you made friends for life.
 This year has tested all of us in so many ways and yet one thought continues to ring true more
 than ever, “Nihil sine Labore”, our school’s motto. It took you twelve years of hard work and
 dedication to get to where you are today and we celebrate this great achievement with you.
 Nonetheless, this is the beginning of a new chapter in your life, and you must remember
 that whether you continue studying or you start working, nothing worth achieving will
 come without labour.
 Matrics of 2020, I wish you all the best for the future professionally as well as personally.
 May you ﬁnd your passion in life and work hard to pursue it to the fullest!

            It is all about the energy you give and the eﬀort
            you put in that makes a diﬀerence.  In saying that,
            you can either be the candle and give light or the
            mirror that reﬂects it.  In both ways you are
            spreading the light of yourself or of others and
            therefore it is how you carry yourself and what
            you give oﬀ that aﬀects those around you.
            It is your choice to decide whether that light is
            positive or negative.

                                separates into valuable metals.
                                You have missed so many special times in your Matric year.  However, I am sure you
                                have learnt a lot about yourself and your capabilities during this time.  I am conﬁdent
                                that this will hold you in good stead in the future.                                                                                                  Bandile Duma         Tyrel van Staden      Shawn Bingham         Melokuhle Mzobe          Asanda Cele
                                Although I have only spent a short time with you, it has been an honour and a privilege
                                to work with this amazing prefect group.                                                                                                           ?  MR KAPP,  please tell us ....... What is the most daring thing you’ve ever done?

                                one thing is certain: the end of your high school career is at hand.                                                                                  At the time the country was closed to tourists due to terror attacks. We negotiated with a

 I remember sitting in Grade 8 just waiting for the day I can matriculate, and here the day has
 come, but now I do not think I’m ready to leave yet.

 us, but one thing I am grateful for, is that we still get to matriculate together as

 I am grateful for the teachers I came across that really inspired me and they are the reason

 may not interact with each other, we know each others names and have each others backs.    2020 need I say more!
 As we have now reached the end of our school career I wish every one of you all the best   I’m sure just about everybody is looking back right now and  thinking,

 KIRSTEN MACKINNON
 2O2O Head Girl
 Matrics, can you believe our school career is over?  It feels like just the other day that we
 arrived at Amanzimtoti High School, excited but so nervous, uncertain but determined to
 make the most of all that high school had in store.
 Over the last ﬁve years we have grown together, made memories that will always be with
 us and built friendships that have carried us through hard times.
 2020 was meant to be an exciting year of celebrating what we have achieved and how far
 we have come.  Instead, Covid-19 arrived and swallowed up all our best plans and long
 held dreams.  It could be easy to remember this year for all we have lost but I have decided

 to look at 2020 in the light of all I have learnt about ﬁnding joy and life in the midst of challenge.
 I have so much to be grateful for!

 2020 has most certainly been a year that has bought about huge
 challenges.  However, 2020 has also provided great opportunities.
 I am immensely proud of every single Amanzimtoti High learner.
 Thank you very much for the way in which you have accepted the
 reality of 2020.
 It was not always easy, but you did it – and the result is that you
 have evolved stronger and far greater at the end of it all.

 This year will form part of History–and you will be a major part of it.
 The hardships that you faced this year certainly contributed so
     much to who you are today.
 Attitude is everything in life.  Your attitude determines your altitude.  I fully believe that the
 attitude that you approached your challenges with this year, is what has made all the diﬀerence.
 You are a dedicated group of learners, displaying tenacity and courage.
 I know you will be able to approach your future head on and achieve huge successes.

 Remember to never stop moving forward.  On this path of life, many of us will stumble along
  the way.  Get up, dust yourself oﬀ and continue, no matter how dark it may seem at the time.
 There is always a light ahead.  Just dig deep into your inner strength and let your own light
 shine even brighter.
 The greatest thing that you can do for yourself is to use every opportunity.
 Continue to be the hero that you are destined to be.
 Always strive to be the better version of yourself.
 Bruce Lee said:  ”Pain is a privilege.  Use it to become stronger, bolder and better.”
 Always remember the words of Jeremiah 29:11:  “For I know the plans I have for you, declares
 the Lord, plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future”.
 With my best wishes,
 Deputy Principal
 Deputy Principal  Mr Kapp  Staff and SGB thank our Amanzimtoti families,
 Mrs Lemmer                   Amanzimtoti High School, Management,

                          Students and Sponsors for incredible support
 Saying goodbye to our Matrics is always a bittersweet moment.   and understanding during this challenging year.
 On the one hand, we are happy that you have achieved your goal
 and can move on to better things, on the other, it is sad to part
 ways. During the past ﬁve years, we have got to know most of you
 quite well. We met your parents, guardians, other family members.
 We learned many family stories, some personality traits, your
 strengths and your weaknesses. For ﬁve years, we tried, to the best
 of our ability, to give you the most suitable tools for your future.
 We may have made mistakes along the way, but what I can
 promise you is that we had your best interests at heart. I hope
 that all of you felt in your time here, that Amanzimtoti High School   Contact Details:
 was not only a place where you were taught subject knowledge, but    30 Dartnell Road
 also a place where you learned values and a place where you made friends for life.   031 903 2374
 This year has tested all of us in so many ways and yet one thought continues to ring true more   admin@totihigh.co.za
 than ever, “Nihil sine Labore”, our school’s motto. It took you twelve years of hard work and   www.totihigh.co.za
 dedication to get to where you are today and we celebrate this great achievement with you.
 Nonetheless, this is the beginning of a new chapter in your life, and you must remember
 that whether you continue studying or you start working, nothing worth achieving will
 come without labour.                  ©    Amanzimtoti High School 2020 Yearbook
 Matrics of 2020, I wish you all the best for the future professionally as well as personally.
 May you ﬁnd your passion in life and work hard to pursue it to the fullest!
