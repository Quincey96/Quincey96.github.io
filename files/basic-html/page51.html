 2O2O Head Girl
 Matrics, can you believe our school career is over?  It feels like just the other day that we
 arrived at Amanzimtoti High School, excited but so nervous, uncertain but determined to
 make the most of all that high school had in store.
 Over the last ﬁve years we have grown together, made memories that will always be with
 us and built friendships that have carried us through hard times.
 2020 was meant to be an exciting year of celebrating what we have achieved and how far
 we have come.  Instead, Covid-19 arrived and swallowed up all our best plans and long
 held dreams.  It could be easy to remember this year for all we have lost but I have decided

 to look at 2020 in the light of all I have learnt about ﬁnding joy and life in the midst of challenge.
 I have so much to be grateful for!
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Danelle Du Plessis          Junior Nxumalo               Paige Cook                Troy Du Toit
 I am grateful that the prefects were able to successfully organise all of our annual functions in one term, and to  have
 left a legacy with the successful start of a new AHS tradition:  The Grade 8 Talent Show.  I am grateful for the continuous

 grateful for the friends I have made who have taught me so much.  I am grateful to have been in a excellent school
 where learning could continue despite the corona virus.  I am grateful to be able to go to university next year, a privilege
 I don't take for granted.  I am grateful for all the memories I have made that I will cherish forever.
 Finally, to the staﬀ and to the school;  I am grateful for the privilege of having served as your head girl this year.  It has
 been the greatest honour of my life so far and I hope that I have done you proud.  I have given my best and I have learnt
 so much.  To the prefect body, you are a remarkable group of people and it has been a great blessing to be a part of the
 team.  To my head prefect, thank you for making me laugh and always having my back.
 Matrics, despite everything that has challenged us , we stand ready to write our Matric Finals!  We have become creative
 and resilient, determined and brave.  We are more ready for adult life than any group before us because of the challenges
 we have faced this year.  Let’s celebrate high school;  all its highs and lows, our successes and our failures, they have
 made us who we are and nothing can take that away from us.  So be proud of who you are!  Make choices that are true
 to you and what you love.  Seize every opportunity and have no regrets.  Live life courageously and with love.  May God
 favour and protect each one of you.
