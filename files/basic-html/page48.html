                                Judge Danford in ‘The Crucible’ said,
                                ‘We burn a hot ﬁre here; it melts down all concealment.’                                                                                           Matric Art            Matric Art            Matric Art            Matric Art             Matric Art            Matric Art
                                I am sure that, during this time, you have felt like you were in that crucible experiencing
                                extreme tests and trials.  Remember, when metal is placed inside a melting pot, it
                                separates into valuable metals.
                                You have missed so many special times in your Matric year.  However, I am sure you
                                have learnt a lot about yourself and your capabilities during this time.  I am conﬁdent
                                that this will hold you in good stead in the future.                                                                                                  Bandile Duma         Tyrel van Staden      Shawn Bingham         Melokuhle Mzobe          Asanda Cele
                                Although I have only spent a short time with you, it has been an honour and a privilege
                                to work with this amazing prefect group.                                                                                                           ?  MR KAPP,  please tell us ....... What is the most daring thing you’ve ever done?

                                I really don't think anyone can sum up this school year in a single sentence, but
                                one thing is certain: the end of your high school career is at hand.                                                                                  At the time the country was closed to tourists due to terror attacks. We negotiated with a
                                You have faced many challenges and uncertainties, you have experienced that which                                                                     local taxi driver and oﬀ we went. It ended up being a beautiful idyllic sunset, us on
                                none before you have and very few after you will.                                                                                                     horseback in the desert with the majestic Pyramids in the background.
                                During times of great change there are also great opportunities.
                                I would encourage you all to seek new ways to do old things, be thankful for what you                                                                 I vividly remember the cool desert blowing through my wife’s hair, the mystic chanting in
                                have and seek out what others may not see.                                                                                                            the background and the clip-clop of the horses hooves on the ancient cobble stoned

                                You all have great potential!  Work hard, stand for what you believe in, don't change for
                                anyone unless it is to bring improvement and never waste a second.                                                                                    only Western people on the streets (my wife’s skimpy outﬁt in a Muslim state did not help).
                                I have so much more I wish to say but most of all;  I encourage you to read Proverbs 3.                                                               We rushed back over the festively lit up Nile river and just made it back in time
                                Looking forward to seeing you all sometime in the future.                                                                                             to the airport. My nerves were ﬁnished at the end of the trip.
                                Mr Rossouw
                                                                                                                                                                                      It was a huge risk but was well worth it in the end.”
