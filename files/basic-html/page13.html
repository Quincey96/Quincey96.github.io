 In die see se skuim
              - Grade 11
 You cry out when telling the story
 Lê daar ‘n geheim
 Of how you found me in war
 Dis die storie van die oseaan
 Uthando olujulile ilolu oluthanda ngaphakathi
 I laugh with you and your men,
 En mens se drome kom daarvandaan
 kwakho.
 But not for the reason you think
 Uthando olweqiniso uluthola ngaphakathi
 Die taal van die sees
 I laugh at your foolishness, old king
 kwakho.
 Is een wat min spreek
 So secure in your seat
 Ukuzithanda ngokweqiniso ukuvuma ukuthi
 Dis ‘n verlore lied
 That you did not notice a serpent
 konke ngawe kwanele.
 Van hierdie mooi gebied
 enter your court
 Wanele njengomuntu futhi njengoba
 unjalo, uyazithanda.
 Die oseaan is vol stories
 Beware, you foolish king
 Uthando olubalulekile ilolu oluphuma kuwe
 For this was my plan
 Sit jou oor teen die skulpies
 Zithande, Zithande.
 You think me a foolish damsel
 En luister na die koor
 Kukho konke okwenzayo ungakhohlwa
 But you are wrong
 En droom van alles wat jy hoor
 Ukuzithanda.
 I am the God of War.
